# InstantSocietyGenerator
This project is to serve as a demo for use by Aiden Wright and Daniel VanRyn
In InstantSocietyGenerator (ISG) there are two main features: Terrain and Agents

# Terrain

# Agents
The agents are intended to demonstrate 2 primary things. One, they are built with a
simple set of actions with which they can interact with the environment. Their operation is
intended to be lightweight and simple. The second focus is on an implementation of machine
learning. By sampling the environment and training actions taken on a singular goal, the intent
is to allow for the agents to improve at this goal in their given environment.
